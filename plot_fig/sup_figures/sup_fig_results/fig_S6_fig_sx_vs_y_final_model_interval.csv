Predicted cancer cell proportions,mean of CPE,lower boundary (2.5%) ,upper bound (97.5%),,,
"[0.1,0.2)",0.444,0.097,0.791,,,The confidence interval (CI) for each Deside-predicted range of cancer cell proportions was calculated by assuming a normal distribution of the samples within the corresponding CPE range.The values were set to 1 if they were larger than 1.
